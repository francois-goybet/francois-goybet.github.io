      <p>
        ▪ Explored processor FPGA routing optimization by analyzing how net ordering affects congestion and path cost.
        Developed ML-based methods to predict efficient net sequences, significantly improving routing quality in complex circuit graphs.

        <span class="item-date"><strong>June 2024 – August 2024</strong></span>
      </div>
      <p>
        ▪ Analyzed train operation data to optimize energy consumption and predict infrastructure faults.
        Used statistical modeling and machine learning (linear regression, RNNs) to quantify driver impact on energy usage
        and to build time series models for early detection of track defects.

        <span class="item-date"><strong>January 2024 – May 2024</strong></span>
      </div>
      <p>
        ▪ Built an end-to-end framework enabling natural language querying over structured data by translating user input to SPARQL using a fine-tuned language model.
        Integrated multiple components (NLP, LLMs, SPARQL) into a unified system hosted on AWS,
        using NASA JPL datasets to evaluate performance.
