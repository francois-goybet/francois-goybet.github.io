    <h3><strong>Understanding Correlation between Sink Orders and Resulting Route Trees</strong> – EPFL Parsa</h3>
    <p><em>February 2025 – June 2025</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Explored FPGA routing optimization by analyzing how net ordering affects congestion and path cost. Developed ML-based methods to predict efficient net sequences, achieving an average 15% reduction in routing tree nodes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>Descriptive Analysis of Train Operations</strong> - GetLink Group Paris</h3>
    <p><em>June 2024 – August 2024</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Performed a quantitative analysis of train operation data using OLS regression, achieving an R² of 0.90 when modeling electrical energy consumption. Estimated driver impact using regression coefficients and confidence intervals. Showed that if all drivers adopted behaviors of the top 10-percentile performers, overall energy consumption would decrease by 5%.</li>
